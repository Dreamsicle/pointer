# Pointer
Discord bot

## Installing & Updating

To keep Pointer updated, you don't need to do anything. It automatically installs any updates available on startup.

### Installing

You need to have NodeJS and Git installed beforehand.

  - In my testing, node-chakracore seems to run Pointer much faster than the standard V8 version of Node.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Dreamsicle/pointer.git`

  - If you download the zip, updates don't work and the bot will fail to start.
 
2. Run `npm-install`

3. Run `node .`
